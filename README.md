# Monty Hall Simulation Frontend

This project is a web application that simulates the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle. The application allows users to run multiple simulations and analyze whether switching doors increases the chances of winning.

## Overview

The Monty Hall problem is based on a game show scenario where a contestant is presented with three doors. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two doors are goats. After the contestant picks a door, the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat. The contestant is then given the choice to stick with their original pick or switch to the other unopened door.

### Project Features:
- **Simulation:** Users can specify the number of simulations and choose whether to switch doors after the host reveals a goat.
- **Results Visualization:** The application displays the results of the simulations visually.
- **Backend:** The simulation logic is implemented in a C#/.NET Core backend.
- **Frontend:** The user interface is built using Angular.

## Technical Requirements

- **Backend:** Developed with C# / .NET Core.
- **Frontend:** Developed with Angular.
- **Testing:** The project includes both unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure the accuracy of the simulations and the reliability of the application.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
